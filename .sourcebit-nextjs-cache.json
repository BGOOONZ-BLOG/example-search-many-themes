The files are compiled in the `./src/styles` folder and then will be passed through copy (see `.eleventy.js`) to the new site created under `./dist/`. For Netlify users, an alternative option with plugins is explained here: [https://css-tricks.com/making-my-netlify-build-run-sass/](https://css-tricks.com/making-my-netlify-build-run-sass/).\n- [Critical CSS](https://github.com/gregives/eleventy-critical-css): Critical CSS is automatically included in the head of the document using the [eleventy-critical-css plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eleventy-critical-css).\n- PostCSS ([Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) and [PurgeCSS](https://github.com/FullHuman/purgecss)): Both dependencies have been set up to run through the main css stylesheet after Eleventy has generated the dist folder.\n- Persistent dark mode using local storage as seen here: [https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-dark-mode-on-the-web/](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-dark-mode-on-the-web/)\n- Cache busting via filter based on [https://rob.cogit8.org/posts/2020-10-28-simple-11ty-cache-busting/](https://rob.cogit8.org/posts/2020-10-28-simple-11ty-cache-busting/).\n- HTML minified on prooduction with [https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-minifier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-minifier) package.\n- PWA using [https://github.com/okitavera/eleventy-plugin-pwa](https://github.com/okitavera/eleventy-plugin-pwa) plugin.\n- JS compilation and minification with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) CLI.\n- Image processing with [eleventy-img](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-img) plugin. Generates multiple sizes images in two different formats (jpg and webp), and markup with `<figure>`, `<picture>` and native lazy loading.\n- [Modernizr](https://modernizr.com/) CLI: To build a custom and minified version of the library as seen here: [https://v2.14islands.com/blog/2016/04/20/better-way-to-use-modernizr-with-command-line-config/](https://v2.14islands.com/blog/2016/04/20/better-way-to-use-modernizr-with-command-line-config/).

Click the \"Deploy to Netlify\" button above\nThis will clone this repo to your github account and will deploy a copy of the demo website to your Netlify\naccount (you can create an account during this process if you don't have one)\n\n### 2. Setup authentication\n\nAfter deploying this project, Netlify Identity will add you as a CMS user and\nwill email you an invite. Hit the \"Accept the invite\" link and this should take you to the deployed site. From there, you can add your password to finish user setup.\n\n### 3. Edit some content\nNow that you are added as a CMS user, add `/admin` to the end of your site url, and log in using your new credentials. You should now see the content editor interface. Now you can start editing content! Any changes to your new repo will auto-deploy a new version to netflify. Cool huh?\n\n### 4. Setup local environment\n- Clone the repo locally `git clone https://github.com/TylerMRoderick/fernfolio-11ty-template.git`\n- Navigate to root folder `cd your-site`\n- Install the goods `npm install`\n- Run it: `npm start`\n- You should now be able to see everything running on localhost:8080\n- Add some changes (view [theme customizations](https://fernfolio.netlify.app/posts/theme-customizations/) for some options)\n- Push your changes to github and an auto-deploy should be triggered\n\n## üé© Common issues\n\nIf you change the repo that was created at deploy time from public to private, you'll need to regenerate your token,\nas the token generated using the deploy to Netlify button can only access public repositories.

Add `gem \"garth-jekyll-theme\"` to your `Gemfile` to add the theme as a dependancy\n2. Run the command `bundle install` in the root of project to install the theme and its dependancies\n3. Add `theme: garth-jekyll-theme` to your `_config.yml` file to set the site theme\n4. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build and serve your site\n5. Done! Use the example [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/garth/blob/master/_config.yml) file to set site-wide options\n\n### As a GitHub Pages remote theme\n\n1. Add `gem \"jekyll-remote-theme\"` to your `Gemfile` to add the theme as a dependancy\n2. Run the command `bundle install` in the root of project to install the jekyll remote theme gem as a dependancy\n3. Add `jekyll-remote-theme` to the list of `plugins` in your `_config.yml` file\n4. Add `remote_theme: daviddarnes/garth` to your `_config.yml` file to set the site theme\n5. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build and serve your site\n6. Done! Use the example [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/garth/blob/master/_config.yml) file to set site-wide options\n\n### As a Boilerplate / Fork\n\n_(deprecated, not recommended)_\n\n1. [Fork the repo](https://github.com/daviddarnes/garth#fork-destination-box)\n2. Replace the `Gemfile` with one stating all the gems used in your project\n3. Delete the following unnecessary files/folders: `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `LICENSE`, `screenshot.png`, `CNAME` and `garth-jekyll-theme.gemspec`\n4. Run the command `bundle install` in the root of project to install the jekyll remote theme gem as a dependancy\n5. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build and serve your site\n6. Done! Use the example [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/garth/blob/master/_config.yml) file to set site-wide options\n\n## Customising\n\nWhen using Garth as a theme means you can take advantage of the file overriding method. This allows you to overwrite any file in this theme with your own custom file, by matching the file name and path. The most common example of this would be if you want to add your own styles or change the core style settings.\n\nTo add your own styles copy the [`styles.scss`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/garth/blob/master/assets/styles.scss) into your own project with the same file path (`assets/styles.scss`). From there you can add your own styles, you can even optionally ignore the theme styles by removing the `@import \"garth\";` line.\n\nIf you're looking to set your own colours copy the [`_colors.scss`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/garth/blob/master/_sass/_colors.scss) and main theme styles file [`garth.scss`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/garth/blob/master/_sass/garth.scss) into your project at the same file path (`_sass/`) and change variables however you wish. The settings are a mixture of custom variables and settings from [Sassline](https://medium.com/@jakegiltsoff/sassline-v2-0-e424b2881e7e) - follow the link to find out how to configure the typographic settings.\n\n## Site settings\n\nYou'll need to change the `description`, `title` and `url` to match with the project.\n\n## Page layouts\n\nThere are 3 layouts; `page`, `post` and `home` (home acts as the font page blog).\n\n> **Note:** The Post List Page options are actually in the collection data within the `_config.yml` file, this is so they can be edited with CMSs such as [Siteleaf](https://siteleaf.com)\n\n## Credits\n\n- Thanks to [Sassline](https://sassline.com/) for the typographic basis, by [Jake Giltsoff](https://twitter.com/jakegiltsoff)\n- Thanks to [Flexbox

project","stale":false,"markdown_content":"\n# Gatsby + Netlify CMS Starter\n\n**Note:** This starter uses [Gatsby v2](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-09-17-gatsby-v2/).\n\nThis repo contains an example business website that is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org): **[Demo Link](https://gatsby-netlify-cms.netlify.com/)**.\n\nIt follows the [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org) by using Git as a single source of truth, and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for continuous deployment, and CDN distribution.\n\n## Features\n\n- A simple landing page with blog functionality built with Netlify CMS\n- Editabe Pages: Landing, About, Product, Blog-Collection and Contact page with Netlify Form support\n- Create Blog posts from Netlify CMS\n- Tags: Separate page for posts under each tag\n- Basic directory organization\n- Uses Bulma for styling, but size is reduced by `purge-css-plugin`\n- Blazing fast loading times thanks to pre-rendered HTML and automatic chunk loading of JS files\n- Uses `gatsby-image` with Netlify-CMS preview support\n- Separate components for everything\n- Netlify deploy configuration\n- Netlify function support, see `lambda` folder\n- Perfect score on Lighthouse for SEO, Accessibility and Performance (wip:PWA)\n- ..and more\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Node (I recommend using v8.2.0 or higher)\n- [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/)\n- [Netlify CLI](https://github.com/netlify/cli)\n\n## Getting Started (Recommended)\n\nNetlify CMS can run in any frontend web environment, but the quickest way to try it out is by running it on a pre-configured starter site with Netlify. The example here is the Kaldi coffee company template (adapted from [One Click Hugo CMS](https://github.com/netlify-templates/one-click-hugo-cms)). Use the button below to build and deploy your own copy of the repository:\n\n<a href=\"https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms&amp;stack=cms\"><img src=\"https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg\" alt=\"Deploy to Netlify\"></a>\n\nAfter clicking that button, you‚Äôll authenticate with GitHub and choose a repository name. Netlify will then automatically create a repository in your GitHub account with a copy of the files from the template. Next, it will build and deploy the new site on Netlify, bringing you to the site dashboard when the build is complete. Next, you‚Äôll need to set up Netlify‚Äôs Identity service to authorize users to log in to the CMS.\n\n### Access Locally\n\nPulldown a local copy of the Github repository Netlify created for you, with the name you specified in the previous step\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/[GITHUB_USERNAME]/[REPO_NAME].git\n$ cd [REPO_NAME]\n$ yarn\n$ netlify dev # or ntl dev\n```\n\nThis uses the new [Netlify Dev](https://www.netlify.com/products/dev/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=netlifycms&utm_campaign=devex) CLI feature to serve any functions you have in the `lambda` folder.\n\nTo test the CMS locally, you'll need run a production build of the site:\n\n```\n$ npm run build\n$ netlify dev # or ntl dev\n```\n\n### Media Libraries (installed, but optional)\n\nMedia Libraries have been included in this starter as a default. If you are not planning to use `Uploadcare` or `Cloudinary` in your project, you **can** remove them from module import and registration in `src/cms/cms.js`. Here is an example of the lines to comment or remove them your project.\n\n```javascript\nimport CMS from 'netlify-cms-app'\n// import uploadcare from 'netlify-cms-media-library-uploadcare'\n// import cloudinary from 'netlify-cms-media-library-cloudinary'\n\nimport AboutPagePreview from './preview-templates/AboutPagePreview'\nimport BlogPostPreview from './preview-templates/BlogPostPreview'\nimport ProductPagePreview from './preview-templates/ProductPagePreview'\nimport IndexPagePreview from './preview-templates/IndexPagePreview'\n\n// CMS.registerMediaLibrary(uploadcare);\n// CMS.registerMediaLibrary(cloudinary);\n\nCMS.registerPreviewTemplate('index', IndexPagePreview)\nCMS.registerPreviewTemplate('about', AboutPagePreview)\nCMS.registerPreviewTemplate('products', ProductPagePreview)\nCMS.registerPreviewTemplate('blog', BlogPostPreview)\n```\n\nNote: Don't forget to also remove them from `package.json` and `yarn.lock` / `package-lock.json` using `yarn` or `npm`. During the build netlify-cms-app will bundle the media libraries as well, having them removed will save you build time.\nExample:\n```\nyarn remove netlify-cms-media-library-uploadcare\n```\nOR\n```\nyarn remove netlify-cms-media-library-cloudinary\n```\n## Getting Started (Without Netlify)\n\n```\n$ gatsby new [SITE_DIRECTORY_NAME] https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms/\n$ cd [SITE_DIRECTORY_NAME]\n$ npm run build\n$ npm run serve\n```\n\n### Setting up the CMS\n\nFollow the [Netlify CMS Quick Start Guide](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/quick-start/#authentication) to set up authentication, and hosting.\n\n## Debugging\n\nWindows users might encounter `node-gyp` errors when trying to npm install.\nTo resolve, make sure that you have both Python 2.7 and the Visual C++ build environment installed.\n\n```\nnpm config set python python2.7\nnpm install --global --production windows-build-tools\n```\n\n[Full details here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gyp 'NPM node-gyp page')\n\nMacOS users might also encounter some errors, for more info check [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp). We recommend using the latest stable node version.\n\n## Purgecss\n\nThis plugin uses [gatsby-plugin-purgecss](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-purgecss/) and [bulma](https://bulma.io/). The bulma builds are usually ~170K but reduced 90% by purgecss.\n\n# CONTRIBUTING\n\nContributions are always welcome, no matter how large or small. Before contributing,\nplease read the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)."},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/theme/gatsby-starter-newage.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/workspace/example-search-many-themes/content/pages","relSourcePath":"theme/gatsby-starter-newage.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/theme/gatsby-starter-newage.md","modelType":"page","modelName":"JamstackTheme","modelLabel":"Jamstack

Happy coding üéâüíª\n\n## Configure your Airtable connection\n\nInside your `gridsome.config.js` file, you'll see the following:\n\n```javascript\n// gridsome.config.js //\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  siteName: 'Site Name',\n  plugins: [\n    {\n      use: '@gridsome/source-airtable',\n      options: {\n        // Add these to a .env file\n        // Details on finding these values can be found at:\n        // https://gridsome.org/plugins/@gridsome/source-airtable\n        apiKey: process.env.AIRTABLE_KEY, //required\n        baseId: process.env.AIRTABLE_BASE, //required\n        tableName: 'Events', //required\n        typeName: 'Event', //required - needs to match template name\n        route: '/events/:name' //optional\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\n- `apiKey` is the API secret provided by Airtable\n- `baseId` is the identifier for the base you would like to connect to\n- `tableName` is the table you would like to pull data from\n- `typeName` is what you would like to call your data in GraphQL\n- `route` is the optional path you would like to use for accessing your records. This can use GraphQL keys to identify records.\n\n**Note:** In order for your templates to generate properly at the specified route a `typeName.vue` file must exist in `\\templates`. In this starter, this is `\\templates\\Event.vue` for the `Event` type.\n\n### dotenv file\n\n[Details on Gridsome Environment Variables.](https://gridsome.org/docs/environment-variables)\n\nYou'll need to create the file `.env` in your root project directory (The same level as `gridsome.config.js`) with the following (replace with your values):\n\n```dotenv\nAIRTABLE_KEY=<apiKey>\nAIRTABLE_BASE=<baseId>\n```\n\nYou can learn more about getting these values from the [plugin page](https://gridsome.org/plugins/@gridsome/source-airtable).\n\n**NOTE:** When you deploy to Netlify, you'll need to setup these values under \"Build & Deploy\" > \"Environment\" > \"Environment Variables\"\n\n## Query Pages\n\nA list of files where the starter uses queries to make updating easier (all from the `src` folder):\n\n- `pages/Events.vue` - Grabs all Events sorted by `startDate`\n- `components/EventCard.vue` - Brings Props in from `pages/Events.vue`\n- `templates/Event.vue` - Uses `id` to pull in data from Airtable.\n\n## My Airtable\nThis is what my Airtable Base looks like:\n\n![\"Airtable with columns for Name, Header Image, Start Date, End Date, Excerpt, Notes, and Attachments.\"](./airtableSetup.png)\n\n\n# Deploy with Netlify\n[![Deploy to

Which would ultimately allow somebody to turn their Obsidian notes into an online blog by simply using the `_notes` directory.\n\n## Features\nHere are a few interesting features of this Jekyll theme:\n\n- A fully customizable and empty `_BLANK_config.yml` to make getting up-and-running easy.\n- A speedy, on-site search function using [Simply Jekyll Search](https://github.com/christian-fei/Simple-Jekyll-Search).\n- Custom collections for different types of material (note-taking, journal writing, etc.)\n- An auto-generating `/archive` page that displays all entries from _all_ collections.\n- Auto-generating `/tags` and `/categories` pages.\n- Breadcrumbs for improved navigation and SEO.\n- Having a `_pages` collection for easier organization.\n- An author bio at the end of each post. (Located in `_inclues/author.html`)\n- Full Rouge support for [syntax highlighting](https://spsarolkar.github.io/rouge-theme-preview/).

Toggle between schemes hassle-free, create new ones on the go, and store settings in-browser.\n\nCheck out the [Demo site](https://jekyll-jek.netlify.app/), deployed and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).\n\n_Warning - this theme requires Jekyll 4 and so will **not** work on GitHub Pages (with Jekyll 3), unless you add a custom CI flow using GitHub Actions._\n\n\n## ‚ö° Features\n\n+ [x] toggle light/dark\n+ [x] choose random theme \n+ [x] save current theme for next visit\n+ [x] open/close settings\n+ [x] clear settings \n\n## üí° All About The Theme \n\nTheme settings are saved in [session](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage) and [local](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) storage. Toggling light/dark mode or choosing a random palette saves settings for only the current session. Clicking the save button adds the theme to local storage for future visits.   \n\n## üõ†Ô∏è Installation  \n\nIt's recommended to install Jek by cloning the [repository](https://github.com/tcbutler320/jek). Installation with Gem's will be supported in a future release.\n\n## üç≠ Default Themes \n\n![Demo video](/assets/img/readme/jek.gif)\n\n## üë©‚ÄçüöÄ Add New Themes  \n\nAdding new themes to your new jek site could not be easier. Just pick a background color and text color and add them to your `main.css`. Once you're done, add your theme to `_data/themes.yaml`. Check out [colorhunt](https://colorhunt.co/) for inspiration.\n\n1. Add a new scheme to your `main.css` with `background-color` and `color` set.  \n    ```css\n    .mytheme {\n      background-color: #0a1d37;\n      color: #ffeedb;\n    }\n    ```  \n2. Add a color scheme name to your `_data/themes.yaml`.  \n    ```yaml\n    - name: mytheme\n      enabled: true\n    ```\n\n## ‚úçÔ∏è Contributing  \n\nIf you're interested in contributing to Jek, feel free to fork the repository and make a pull request! If you made a cool new theme and want to add it to the defaults, create an issue and add the [*Theme Suggestion*](https://github.com/tcbutler320/jek/labels/Theme%20Suggestion) label.  \n\n## ‚öñÔ∏è

[**Water.css** framework](https://github.com/kognise/water.css) (hence the name!), while still following the best practices possible for accessibility and search-engine optimization.\n\nI created this because I wasn't able to find an up-to-date starter/skeleton theme for Jekyll. Even the default theme, Minima, uses the large Bootstrap framework.\n\nThis project is aimed towards those curious about using Jekyll for the first time, and want to build from as close to scratch as possible. Alternatively, it still has all the features required for creating a hassle-free, informational website or blog in just a few clicks.\n\nAs of November 1st, 2020, with >70 posts on Watery, the website scores a perfect 100 in Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO on an audit with [**Google Lighthouse**](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse).\n\n## Features\n\nDespite Watery's minimalist nature, there are a few interesting features that have been added:\n\n- A fully customizable and empty `_BLANK_config.yml` to make getting up-and-running easy.\n- Having a `_pages` collection for easier organization.\n- Auto-generated links in navigation to all pages in `_pages`.\n- Auto-generated [tags page](https://watery.netlify.app/tags) that lists all tags used by all posts in chronological order.\n- An author bio at the end of each post. (Located in `_inclues/author.html`)\n- Full [Rouge](https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge) support for syntax code highlighting. (Currently using `base16.solarized.light`)\n- Auto-generated RSS feed, sitemap, accessibility features, and search-engine optimization.\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/theme/jekyll-web-presentation-theme.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/workspace/example-search-many-themes/content/pages","relSourcePath":"theme/jekyll-web-presentation-theme.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/theme/jekyll-web-presentation-theme.md","modelType":"page","modelName":"JamstackTheme","modelLabel":"Jamstack Theme","urlPath":"/theme/jekyll-web-presentation-theme"},"layout":"JamstackTheme","title":"Web-presentation","github":"https://github.com/deepidea/web-presentation","demo":"https://deepidea.github.io/web-presentation/","author":"DeepIdea","ssg":"Jekyll","date":"2017-10-15T05:35:15.000Z","description":"Jekyll theme template to create web presentation","stale":true,"markdown_content":null},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/theme/jekyll-webjeda-ashwath.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/workspace/example-search-many-themes/content/pages","relSourcePath":"theme/jekyll-webjeda-ashwath.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/theme/jekyll-webjeda-ashwath.md","modelType":"page","modelName":"JamstackTheme","modelLabel":"Jamstack Theme","urlPath":"/theme/jekyll-webjeda-ashwath"},"layout":"JamstackTheme","title":"Webjeda Ashwath","github":"https://github.com/sharu725/ashwath","demo":"https://webjeda.com/ashwath/","author":"webjeda","ssg":"Jekyll","date":"2017-03-22T19:17:15.000Z","description":"Minimal Jekyll Theme with an app like layout","stale":false,"disabled":true,"disabled_reason":"demo url not found","markdown_content":null},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/theme/jekyll-webjeda-cards.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/workspace/example-search-many-themes/content/pages","relSourcePath":"theme/jekyll-webjeda-cards.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/theme/jekyll-webjeda-cards.md","modelType":"page","modelName":"JamstackTheme","modelLabel":"Jamstack Theme","urlPath":"/theme/jekyll-webjeda-cards"},"layout":"JamstackTheme","title":"Webjeda Cards","github":"https://github.com/sharu725/cards","demo":"https://webjeda.com/cards","author":"sharathdt","ssg":"Jekyll","date":"2016-06-16T10:12:17.000Z","description":"A bootstrap based minimal jekyll theme","stale":false,"markdown_content":null},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/theme/jekyll-what-a-theme.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/workspace/example-search-many-themes/content/pages","relSourcePath":"theme/jekyll-what-a-theme.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/theme/jekyll-what-a-theme.md","modelType":"page","modelName":"JamstackTheme","modelLabel":"Jamstack Theme","urlPath":"/theme/jekyll-what-a-theme"},"layout":"JamstackTheme","title":"What A Theme","github":"https://github.com/thedevslot/WhatATheme/","demo":"https://thedevslot.github.io/WhatATheme/","author":"Sneha Omer, Harsh Trivedi","date":"2020-08-22T00:00:00.000Z","ssg":"Jekyll","archetype":["Blog","Portfolio"],"css":["Bulma"],"description":"WhatATheme is a customizable Jekyll Portfolio theme which supports blogging.

LaTeX can be\nwritten more or less as normal.  Some examples:\n\n- This `$ \\frac{1}{2} $` will be rendered inline.\n- A simple displayed equation: `$$f(x, y) := e^{x^2 - y^2}.$$`\n\nThere currently seems to be some weirdness with other environments,\nsuch as the `aligned` environment (`align*` is not supported by katex).  These environments will render provided\nthey are wrapped in `<p>` tags and blank lines.  The snippet below should\nrender correctly.\n```\nLet $G$ be a finite group with exponent $2$.  Then every element is\nan involution, hence for any $x$, $y$ in $G$ we have:\n\n<p>\n\\begin{aligned}\n  e &= (xy)^2  \\\\\n  &=xyxy \\implies \\\\\n  y^{-1} &= xyx \\implies \\\\\n  y^{-1}x^{-1} &= xy,\n\\end{aligned*}\n</p>\n\nestablishing that $G$ is abelian.\n```\n\n### Site Parameters\n\nThe site specific parameters that this theme recognizes are:\n\n- `subtitle` string: This is displayed under the main title.\n- `showPoweredBy` boolean: if true, display a shoutout to Hugo and this theme.\n- `copyrightHolder` string: Inserts the value in the default copyright notice.\n- `copyright` string: Custom copyright notice.\n\n### Page Parameters\n\n- `hideDate` boolean: if true, do not display a page date.  When `meta` is set to\n  true, `hideDate` takes greater precedence.\n- `hideReadTime` boolean: if true, do not display the page's reading time\n  estimate.

The files are compiled in the `./src/styles` folder and then will be passed through copy (see `.eleventy.js`) to the new site created under `./dist/`. For Netlify users, an alternative option with plugins is explained here: [https://css-tricks.com/making-my-netlify-build-run-sass/](https://css-tricks.com/making-my-netlify-build-run-sass/).\n- [Critical CSS](https://github.com/gregives/eleventy-critical-css): Critical CSS is automatically included in the head of the document using the [eleventy-critical-css plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eleventy-critical-css).\n- PostCSS ([Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) and [PurgeCSS](https://github.com/FullHuman/purgecss)): Both dependencies have been set up to run through the main css stylesheet after Eleventy has generated the dist folder.\n- Persistent dark mode using local storage as seen here: [https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-dark-mode-on-the-web/](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-dark-mode-on-the-web/)\n- Cache busting via filter based on [https://rob.cogit8.org/posts/2020-10-28-simple-11ty-cache-busting/](https://rob.cogit8.org/posts/2020-10-28-simple-11ty-cache-busting/).\n- HTML minified on prooduction with [https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-minifier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-minifier) package.\n- PWA using [https://github.com/okitavera/eleventy-plugin-pwa](https://github.com/okitavera/eleventy-plugin-pwa) plugin.\n- JS compilation and minification with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) CLI.\n- Image processing with [eleventy-img](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-img) plugin. Generates multiple sizes images in two different formats (jpg and webp), and markup with `<figure>`, `<picture>` and native lazy loading.\n- [Modernizr](https://modernizr.com/) CLI: To build a custom and minified version of the library as seen here: [https://v2.14islands.com/blog/2016/04/20/better-way-to-use-modernizr-with-command-line-config/](https://v2.14islands.com/blog/2016/04/20/better-way-to-use-modernizr-with-command-line-config/). Yetty is using it to detect if the browser supports Webp as background-image in CSS.\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/theme/11tyframe.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/workspace/example-search-many-themes/content/pages","relSourcePath":"theme/11tyframe.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/theme/11tyframe.md","modelType":"page","modelName":"JamstackTheme","modelLabel":"Jamstack Theme","urlPath":"/theme/11tyframe"},"layout":"JamstackTheme","title":"11tyFrame","github":"https://github.com/octoxalis/11tyframe","demo":"https://11tyframe.netlify.com","author":"Octoxalis","date":"2019-12-25T00:00:00.000Z","ssg":"Eleventy","description":"A light site frame using Eleventy static site generator","stale":true,"markdown_content":null},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/theme/Antarctica.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/workspace/example-search-many-themes/content/pages","relSourcePath":"theme/Antarctica.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/theme/Antarctica.md","modelType":"page","modelName":"JamstackTheme","modelLabel":"Jamstack Theme","urlPath":"/theme/antarctica"},"layout":"JamstackTheme","title":"Antarctica","github":"https://github.com/SdtElectronics/jekyll-theme-antarctica","demo":"https://sdtelectronics.github.io/jekyll-theme-antarctica/","author":"Sdtelectronics","date":"2021-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","ssg":"Jekyll","archetype":["Blog","Portfolio"],"description":"Stylish and feature-rich theme for Jekyll","stale":false,"markdown_content":"\n\n![4U6cuV.png](https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/09/22/4U6cuV.png)\n\n\nThe goal of Antarctica is evolving to an elegant and feature-rich theme across platforms.\n\n\n[Live demo](https://sdtelectronics.github.io/jekyll-theme-antarctica/)\n\n## Features\n* Fully responsive layout achieves best visual on different screens\n* Flexible widgets provide extensible functionality\n* Integrated [NerdFonts](www.nerdfonts.com) with 3000+ icons\n* Automatic sitemap generation with [Jekyll Sitemap](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap)\n* Configuration-free search engine optimization with [Jekyll Seo Tag](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag)\n* Reduced JavaScript usage to accelerate loading.

Click the \"Deploy to Netlify\" button above\nThis will clone this repo to your github account and will deploy a copy of the demo website to your Netlify\naccount (you can create an account during this process if you don't have one)\n\n### 2. Setup authentication\n\nAfter deploying this project, Netlify Identity will add you as a CMS user and\nwill email you an invite. Hit the \"Accept the invite\" link and this should take you to the deployed site. From there, you can add your password to finish user setup.\n\n### 3. Edit some content\nNow that you are added as a CMS user, add `/admin` to the end of your site url, and log in using your new credentials. You should now see the content editor interface. Now you can start editing content! Any changes to your new repo will auto-deploy a new version to netflify. Cool huh?\n\n### 4. Setup local environment\n- Clone the repo locally `git clone https://github.com/TylerMRoderick/fernfolio-11ty-template.git`\n- Navigate to root folder `cd your-site`\n- Install the goods `npm install`\n- Run it: `npm start`\n- You should now be able to see everything running on localhost:8080\n- Add some changes (view [theme customizations](https://fernfolio.netlify.app/posts/theme-customizations/) for some options)\n- Push your changes to github and an auto-deploy should be triggered\n\n## üé© Common issues\n\nIf you change the repo that was created at deploy time from public to private, you'll need to regenerate your token,\nas the token generated using the deploy to Netlify button can only access public repositories.

Add `gem \"garth-jekyll-theme\"` to your `Gemfile` to add the theme as a dependancy\n2. Run the command `bundle install` in the root of project to install the theme and its dependancies\n3. Add `theme: garth-jekyll-theme` to your `_config.yml` file to set the site theme\n4. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build and serve your site\n5. Done! Use the example [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/garth/blob/master/_config.yml) file to set site-wide options\n\n### As a GitHub Pages remote theme\n\n1. Add `gem \"jekyll-remote-theme\"` to your `Gemfile` to add the theme as a dependancy\n2. Run the command `bundle install` in the root of project to install the jekyll remote theme gem as a dependancy\n3. Add `jekyll-remote-theme` to the list of `plugins` in your `_config.yml` file\n4. Add `remote_theme: daviddarnes/garth` to your `_config.yml` file to set the site theme\n5. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build and serve your site\n6. Done! Use the example [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/garth/blob/master/_config.yml) file to set site-wide options\n\n### As a Boilerplate / Fork\n\n_(deprecated, not recommended)_\n\n1. [Fork the repo](https://github.com/daviddarnes/garth#fork-destination-box)\n2. Replace the `Gemfile` with one stating all the gems used in your project\n3. Delete the following unnecessary files/folders: `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `LICENSE`, `screenshot.png`, `CNAME` and `garth-jekyll-theme.gemspec`\n4. Run the command `bundle install` in the root of project to install the jekyll remote theme gem as a dependancy\n5. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build and serve your site\n6. Done! Use the example [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/garth/blob/master/_config.yml) file to set site-wide options\n\n## Customising\n\nWhen using Garth as a theme means you can take advantage of the file overriding method. This allows you to overwrite any file in this theme with your own custom file, by matching the file name and path. The most common example of this would be if you want to add your own styles or change the core style settings.\n\nTo add your own styles copy the [`styles.scss`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/garth/blob/master/assets/styles.scss) into your own project with the same file path (`assets/styles.scss`). From there you can add your own styles, you can even optionally ignore the theme styles by removing the `@import \"garth\";` line.\n\nIf you're looking to set your own colours copy the [`_colors.scss`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/garth/blob/master/_sass/_colors.scss) and main theme styles file [`garth.scss`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/garth/blob/master/_sass/garth.scss) into your project at the same file path (`_sass/`) and change variables however you wish. The settings are a mixture of custom variables and settings from [Sassline](https://medium.com/@jakegiltsoff/sassline-v2-0-e424b2881e7e) - follow the link to find out how to configure the typographic settings.\n\n## Site settings\n\nYou'll need to change the `description`, `title` and `url` to match with the project.\n\n## Page layouts\n\nThere are 3 layouts; `page`, `post` and `home` (home acts as the font page blog).\n\n> **Note:** The Post List Page options are actually in the collection data within the `_config.yml` file, this is so they can be edited with CMSs such as [Siteleaf](https://siteleaf.com)\n\n## Credits\n\n- Thanks to [Sassline](https://sassline.com/) for the typographic basis, by [Jake Giltsoff](https://twitter.com/jakegiltsoff)\n- Thanks to [Flexbox

project","stale":false,"markdown_content":"\n# Gatsby + Netlify CMS Starter\n\n**Note:** This starter uses [Gatsby v2](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-09-17-gatsby-v2/).\n\nThis repo contains an example business website that is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org): **[Demo Link](https://gatsby-netlify-cms.netlify.com/)**.\n\nIt follows the [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org) by using Git as a single source of truth, and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for continuous deployment, and CDN distribution.\n\n## Features\n\n- A simple landing page with blog functionality built with Netlify CMS\n- Editabe Pages: Landing, About, Product, Blog-Collection and Contact page with Netlify Form support\n- Create Blog posts from Netlify CMS\n- Tags: Separate page for posts under each tag\n- Basic directory organization\n- Uses Bulma for styling, but size is reduced by `purge-css-plugin`\n- Blazing fast loading times thanks to pre-rendered HTML and automatic chunk loading of JS files\n- Uses `gatsby-image` with Netlify-CMS preview support\n- Separate components for everything\n- Netlify deploy configuration\n- Netlify function support, see `lambda` folder\n- Perfect score on Lighthouse for SEO, Accessibility and Performance (wip:PWA)\n- ..and more\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Node (I recommend using v8.2.0 or higher)\n- [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/)\n- [Netlify CLI](https://github.com/netlify/cli)\n\n## Getting Started (Recommended)\n\nNetlify CMS can run in any frontend web environment, but the quickest way to try it out is by running it on a pre-configured starter site with Netlify. The example here is the Kaldi coffee company template (adapted from [One Click Hugo CMS](https://github.com/netlify-templates/one-click-hugo-cms)). Use the button below to build and deploy your own copy of the repository:\n\n<a href=\"https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms&amp;stack=cms\"><img src=\"https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg\" alt=\"Deploy to Netlify\"></a>\n\nAfter clicking that button, you‚Äôll authenticate with GitHub and choose a repository name. Netlify will then automatically create a repository in your GitHub account with a copy of the files from the template. Next, it will build and deploy the new site on Netlify, bringing you to the site dashboard when the build is complete. Next, you‚Äôll need to set up Netlify‚Äôs Identity service to authorize users to log in to the CMS.\n\n### Access Locally\n\nPulldown a local copy of the Github repository Netlify created for you, with the name you specified in the previous step\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/[GITHUB_USERNAME]/[REPO_NAME].git\n$ cd [REPO_NAME]\n$ yarn\n$ netlify dev # or ntl dev\n```\n\nThis uses the new [Netlify Dev](https://www.netlify.com/products/dev/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=netlifycms&utm_campaign=devex) CLI feature to serve any functions you have in the `lambda` folder.\n\nTo test the CMS locally, you'll need run a production build of the site:\n\n```\n$ npm run build\n$ netlify dev # or ntl dev\n```\n\n### Media Libraries (installed, but optional)\n\nMedia Libraries have been included in this starter as a default. If you are not planning to use `Uploadcare` or `Cloudinary` in your project, you **can** remove them from module import and registration in `src/cms/cms.js`. Here is an example of the lines to comment or remove them your project.\n\n```javascript\nimport CMS from 'netlify-cms-app'\n// import uploadcare from 'netlify-cms-media-library-uploadcare'\n// import cloudinary from 'netlify-cms-media-library-cloudinary'\n\nimport AboutPagePreview from './preview-templates/AboutPagePreview'\nimport BlogPostPreview from './preview-templates/BlogPostPreview'\nimport ProductPagePreview from './preview-templates/ProductPagePreview'\nimport IndexPagePreview from './preview-templates/IndexPagePreview'\n\n// CMS.registerMediaLibrary(uploadcare);\n// CMS.registerMediaLibrary(cloudinary);\n\nCMS.registerPreviewTemplate('index', IndexPagePreview)\nCMS.registerPreviewTemplate('about', AboutPagePreview)\nCMS.registerPreviewTemplate('products', ProductPagePreview)\nCMS.registerPreviewTemplate('blog', BlogPostPreview)\n```\n\nNote: Don't forget to also remove them from `package.json` and `yarn.lock` / `package-lock.json` using `yarn` or `npm`. During the build netlify-cms-app will bundle the media libraries as well, having them removed will save you build time.\nExample:\n```\nyarn remove netlify-cms-media-library-uploadcare\n```\nOR\n```\nyarn remove netlify-cms-media-library-cloudinary\n```\n## Getting Started (Without Netlify)\n\n```\n$ gatsby new [SITE_DIRECTORY_NAME] https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms/\n$ cd [SITE_DIRECTORY_NAME]\n$ npm run build\n$ npm run serve\n```\n\n### Setting up the CMS\n\nFollow the [Netlify CMS Quick Start Guide](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/quick-start/#authentication) to set up authentication, and hosting.\n\n## Debugging\n\nWindows users might encounter `node-gyp` errors when trying to npm install.\nTo resolve, make sure that you have both Python 2.7 and the Visual C++ build environment installed.\n\n```\nnpm config set python python2.7\nnpm install --global --production windows-build-tools\n```\n\n[Full details here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gyp 'NPM node-gyp page')\n\nMacOS users might also encounter some errors, for more info check [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp). We recommend using the latest stable node version.\n\n## Purgecss\n\nThis plugin uses [gatsby-plugin-purgecss](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-purgecss/) and [bulma](https://bulma.io/). The bulma builds are usually ~170K but reduced 90% by purgecss.\n\n# CONTRIBUTING\n\nContributions are always welcome, no matter how large or small. Before contributing,\nplease read the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)."},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/theme/gatsby-starter-newage.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/workspace/example-search-many-themes/content/pages","relSourcePath":"theme/gatsby-starter-newage.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/theme/gatsby-starter-newage.md","modelType":"page","modelName":"JamstackTheme","modelLabel":"Jamstack

Happy coding üéâüíª\n\n## Configure your Airtable connection\n\nInside your `gridsome.config.js` file, you'll see the following:\n\n```javascript\n// gridsome.config.js //\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  siteName: 'Site Name',\n  plugins: [\n    {\n      use: '@gridsome/source-airtable',\n      options: {\n        // Add these to a .env file\n        // Details on finding these values can be found at:\n        // https://gridsome.org/plugins/@gridsome/source-airtable\n        apiKey: process.env.AIRTABLE_KEY, //required\n        baseId: process.env.AIRTABLE_BASE, //required\n        tableName: 'Events', //required\n        typeName: 'Event', //required - needs to match template name\n        route: '/events/:name' //optional\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\n- `apiKey` is the API secret provided by Airtable\n- `baseId` is the identifier for the base you would like to connect to\n- `tableName` is the table you would like to pull data from\n- `typeName` is what you would like to call your data in GraphQL\n- `route` is the optional path you would like to use for accessing your records. This can use GraphQL keys to identify records.\n\n**Note:** In order for your templates to generate properly at the specified route a `typeName.vue` file must exist in `\\templates`. In this starter, this is `\\templates\\Event.vue` for the `Event` type.\n\n### dotenv file\n\n[Details on Gridsome Environment Variables.](https://gridsome.org/docs/environment-variables)\n\nYou'll need to create the file `.env` in your root project directory (The same level as `gridsome.config.js`) with the following (replace with your values):\n\n```dotenv\nAIRTABLE_KEY=<apiKey>\nAIRTABLE_BASE=<baseId>\n```\n\nYou can learn more about getting these values from the [plugin page](https://gridsome.org/plugins/@gridsome/source-airtable).\n\n**NOTE:** When you deploy to Netlify, you'll need to setup these values under \"Build & Deploy\" > \"Environment\" > \"Environment Variables\"\n\n## Query Pages\n\nA list of files where the starter uses queries to make updating easier (all from the `src` folder):\n\n- `pages/Events.vue` - Grabs all Events sorted by `startDate`\n- `components/EventCard.vue` - Brings Props in from `pages/Events.vue`\n- `templates/Event.vue` - Uses `id` to pull in data from Airtable.\n\n## My Airtable\nThis is what my Airtable Base looks like:\n\n![\"Airtable with columns for Name, Header Image, Start Date, End Date, Excerpt, Notes, and Attachments.\"](./airtableSetup.png)\n\n\n# Deploy with Netlify\n[![Deploy to

Which would ultimately allow somebody to turn their Obsidian notes into an online blog by simply using the `_notes` directory.\n\n## Features\nHere are a few interesting features of this Jekyll theme:\n\n- A fully customizable and empty `_BLANK_config.yml` to make getting up-and-running easy.\n- A speedy, on-site search function using [Simply Jekyll Search](https://github.com/christian-fei/Simple-Jekyll-Search).\n- Custom collections for different types of material (note-taking, journal writing, etc.)\n- An auto-generating `/archive` page that displays all entries from _all_ collections.\n- Auto-generating `/tags` and `/categories` pages.\n- Breadcrumbs for improved navigation and SEO.\n- Having a `_pages` collection for easier organization.\n- An author bio at the end of each post. (Located in `_inclues/author.html`)\n- Full Rouge support for [syntax highlighting](https://spsarolkar.github.io/rouge-theme-preview/).

Toggle between schemes hassle-free, create new ones on the go, and store settings in-browser.\n\nCheck out the [Demo site](https://jekyll-jek.netlify.app/), deployed and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).\n\n_Warning - this theme requires Jekyll 4 and so will **not** work on GitHub Pages (with Jekyll 3), unless you add a custom CI flow using GitHub Actions._\n\n\n## ‚ö° Features\n\n+ [x] toggle light/dark\n+ [x] choose random theme \n+ [x] save current theme for next visit\n+ [x] open/close settings\n+ [x] clear settings \n\n## üí° All About The Theme \n\nTheme settings are saved in [session](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage) and [local](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) storage. Toggling light/dark mode or choosing a random palette saves settings for only the current session. Clicking the save button adds the theme to local storage for future visits.   \n\n## üõ†Ô∏è Installation  \n\nIt's recommended to install Jek by cloning the [repository](https://github.com/tcbutler320/jek). Installation with Gem's will be supported in a future release.\n\n## üç≠ Default Themes \n\n![Demo video](/assets/img/readme/jek.gif)\n\n## üë©‚ÄçüöÄ Add New Themes  \n\nAdding new themes to your new jek site could not be easier. Just pick a background color and text color and add them to your `main.css`. Once you're done, add your theme to `_data/themes.yaml`. Check out [colorhunt](https://colorhunt.co/) for inspiration.\n\n1. Add a new scheme to your `main.css` with `background-color` and `color` set.  \n    ```css\n    .mytheme {\n      background-color: #0a1d37;\n      color: #ffeedb;\n    }\n    ```  \n2. Add a color scheme name to your `_data/themes.yaml`.  \n    ```yaml\n    - name: mytheme\n      enabled: true\n    ```\n\n## ‚úçÔ∏è Contributing  \n\nIf you're interested in contributing to Jek, feel free to fork the repository and make a pull request! If you made a cool new theme and want to add it to the defaults, create an issue and add the [*Theme Suggestion*](https://github.com/tcbutler320/jek/labels/Theme%20Suggestion) label.  \n\n## ‚öñÔ∏è

[**Water.css** framework](https://github.com/kognise/water.css) (hence the name!), while still following the best practices possible for accessibility and search-engine optimization.\n\nI created this because I wasn't able to find an up-to-date starter/skeleton theme for Jekyll. Even the default theme, Minima, uses the large Bootstrap framework.\n\nThis project is aimed towards those curious about using Jekyll for the first time, and want to build from as close to scratch as possible. Alternatively, it still has all the features required for creating a hassle-free, informational website or blog in just a few clicks.\n\nAs of November 1st, 2020, with >70 posts on Watery, the website scores a perfect 100 in Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO on an audit with [**Google Lighthouse**](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse).\n\n## Features\n\nDespite Watery's minimalist nature, there are a few interesting features that have been added:\n\n- A fully customizable and empty `_BLANK_config.yml` to make getting up-and-running easy.\n- Having a `_pages` collection for easier organization.\n- Auto-generated links in navigation to all pages in `_pages`.\n- Auto-generated [tags page](https://watery.netlify.app/tags) that lists all tags used by all posts in chronological order.\n- An author bio at the end of each post. (Located in `_inclues/author.html`)\n- Full [Rouge](https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge) support for syntax code highlighting. (Currently using `base16.solarized.light`)\n- Auto-generated RSS feed, sitemap, accessibility features, and search-engine optimization.\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/theme/jekyll-web-presentation-theme.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/workspace/example-search-many-themes/content/pages","relSourcePath":"theme/jekyll-web-presentation-theme.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/theme/jekyll-web-presentation-theme.md","modelType":"page","modelName":"JamstackTheme","modelLabel":"Jamstack Theme","urlPath":"/theme/jekyll-web-presentation-theme"},"layout":"JamstackTheme","title":"Web-presentation","github":"https://github.com/deepidea/web-presentation","demo":"https://deepidea.github.io/web-presentation/","author":"DeepIdea","ssg":"Jekyll","date":"2017-10-15T05:35:15.000Z","description":"Jekyll theme template to create web presentation","stale":true,"markdown_content":null},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/theme/jekyll-webjeda-ashwath.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/workspace/example-search-many-themes/content/pages","relSourcePath":"theme/jekyll-webjeda-ashwath.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/theme/jekyll-webjeda-ashwath.md","modelType":"page","modelName":"JamstackTheme","modelLabel":"Jamstack Theme","urlPath":"/theme/jekyll-webjeda-ashwath"},"layout":"JamstackTheme","title":"Webjeda Ashwath","github":"https://github.com/sharu725/ashwath","demo":"https://webjeda.com/ashwath/","author":"webjeda","ssg":"Jekyll","date":"2017-03-22T19:17:15.000Z","description":"Minimal Jekyll Theme with an app like layout","stale":false,"disabled":true,"disabled_reason":"demo url not found","markdown_content":null},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/theme/jekyll-webjeda-cards.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/workspace/example-search-many-themes/content/pages","relSourcePath":"theme/jekyll-webjeda-cards.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/theme/jekyll-webjeda-cards.md","modelType":"page","modelName":"JamstackTheme","modelLabel":"Jamstack Theme","urlPath":"/theme/jekyll-webjeda-cards"},"layout":"JamstackTheme","title":"Webjeda Cards","github":"https://github.com/sharu725/cards","demo":"https://webjeda.com/cards","author":"sharathdt","ssg":"Jekyll","date":"2016-06-16T10:12:17.000Z","description":"A bootstrap based minimal jekyll theme","stale":false,"markdown_content":null},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/theme/jekyll-what-a-theme.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/workspace/example-search-many-themes/content/pages","relSourcePath":"theme/jekyll-what-a-theme.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/theme/jekyll-what-a-theme.md","modelType":"page","modelName":"JamstackTheme","modelLabel":"Jamstack Theme","urlPath":"/theme/jekyll-what-a-theme"},"layout":"JamstackTheme","title":"What A Theme","github":"https://github.com/thedevslot/WhatATheme/","demo":"https://thedevslot.github.io/WhatATheme/","author":"Sneha Omer, Harsh Trivedi","date":"2020-08-22T00:00:00.000Z","ssg":"Jekyll","archetype":["Blog","Portfolio"],"css":["Bulma"],"description":"WhatATheme is a customizable Jekyll Portfolio theme which supports blogging.

LaTeX can be\nwritten more or less as normal.  Some examples:\n\n- This `$ \\frac{1}{2} $` will be rendered inline.\n- A simple displayed equation: `$$f(x, y) := e^{x^2 - y^2}.$$`\n\nThere currently seems to be some weirdness with other environments,\nsuch as the `aligned` environment (`align*` is not supported by katex).  These environments will render provided\nthey are wrapped in `<p>` tags and blank lines.  The snippet below should\nrender correctly.\n```\nLet $G$ be a finite group with exponent $2$.  Then every element is\nan involution, hence for any $x$, $y$ in $G$ we have:\n\n<p>\n\\begin{aligned}\n  e &= (xy)^2  \\\\\n  &=xyxy \\implies \\\\\n  y^{-1} &= xyx \\implies \\\\\n  y^{-1}x^{-1} &= xy,\n\\end{aligned*}\n</p>\n\nestablishing that $G$ is abelian.\n```\n\n### Site Parameters\n\nThe site specific parameters that this theme recognizes are:\n\n- `subtitle` string: This is displayed under the main title.\n- `showPoweredBy` boolean: if true, display a shoutout to Hugo and this theme.\n- `copyrightHolder` string: Inserts the value in the default copyright notice.\n- `copyright` string: Custom copyright notice.\n\n### Page Parameters\n\n- `hideDate` boolean: if true, do not display a page date.  When `meta` is set to\n  true, `hideDate` takes greater precedence.\n- `hideReadTime` boolean: if true, do not display the page's reading time\n  estimate.
